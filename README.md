# Projekty_PHP
 This repository contains very simple games made during PHP lessons in my school:<br>
 ## Minesweeper (saper) - minesweeper bruh<br>
 ## BlackJack - simple card game<br>
 They may contain some bugs, but Minesweeper was made during my winter-break (I seriously didn't want to do it) and BlackJack in about 5 hours (3h and 20min in school, about 1.5h in home)
