# Projekty_PHP
 This repository contains very simple games made during PHP lessons in my school:
 ##Minesweeper (saper) - minesweeper bruh
 ##BlackJack - simple card game
 They may contain some bugs, but Minesweeper was made during my winter-break (I seriously didn't want to do it) and BlackJack in about 5 hours (3h and 20min in school, about 1.5h in home)
